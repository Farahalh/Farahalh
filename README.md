### Hello I´m Farah👋

<hr/>

Hey there! I'm Farah! 👋
Welcome to my coding corner where lines of code meet creativity! I'm a junior developer, constantly working on new projects and expanding my coding horizons.

🔭 Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of React, creating a calculator that's as functional as it is stylish.

🌱 But hey, the learning never stops! Right now, I'm also sharpening my skills in TypeScript, because who doesn't love a little type safety?

Let's connect and code! ✨
