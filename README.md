### Hello IÂ´m FarahðŸ‘‹

<hr/>

Hey there! I'm Farah! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my coding corner where lines of code meet creativity! I'm a junior developer, constantly working on new projects and expanding my coding knowledge.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm diving into React, creating a calculator that's as functional as it is stylish.

ðŸŒ± But the learning never stops! I'm also learning TypeScript, because who doesn't love a little type safety?

Let's connect and code! âœ¨
